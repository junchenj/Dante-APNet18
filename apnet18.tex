\begin{abstract}
As 360-degree videos grow dramatically in popularity, more 
applications demand the ability to stream 360-degree videos to 
wirelessly connected devices, such as smartphone headsets. However, 
the limited capacity and the unstable network conditions make 
wireless networks ill-suited to the requirements of 
360-degree videos---high resolution and low delay. One common 
approach is to take advantage of the fact that the viewer only
watches a small portion of the video around the 
field of view (FOV). This allows for better allocation of 
network bandwidth by prioritizing content the viewer actually watches. 
Previous efforts on 360-degree videos have largely focused on 
adapting the encoded bitrate to optimize video quality in the 
time-varying FOV. This paper follows the general FOV-aware approach
but uses a different technique. Rather than adapting bitrate, 
we explore the opportunities of a custom underlying 
transport protocol for 360-degree videos.  In particular, we
make a case for using Forward Error Correction (FEC) 
coding over UDP to reduce video streaming delay (a key 
limitation of all TCP-based approaches).
We present {\em Dante}, an FOV-aware UDP-based video streaming protocol 
that adapts to changing network conditions by dynamically
choosing FEC redundancy levels based on how close the video content is
to the FOV region. Experimental 
results show that Dante improves video quality (PSNR) by 20\% to
30\% over traditional UDP-based video 
streaming protocols and 40\% over FOV-aware DASH.

\maketitle

%360-degree videos have been widely applied due to its unprecedented immersive experience. The appreciation of watching 360-degree videos
%on untethered mobile devices, such as smartphone headsets,
%is considered to be a more promising trend, which, however, is hampered by the
%poor Quality of Experience (QoE), subject to limited bandwidth and error-prone characteristic of wireless networks.
%Fortunately, the key observation that only a small portion of a 360-degree video is
%perceived by users at any time, i.e., Field Of View (FOV), implies that unequal attention
%should be given different regions spatially and can
%be utilized to mitigate dependence on stable network condition and ultra-high bandwidth. Currently, the state-of-the-art schemes, like FOV-aware tile-based streaming in the application layer, almost based on FOV-aware bit-rate adaptation, transport protocol of which, however, fails to consider FOV. So, we propose an application-layer protocol, reliability scheme of which is FOV-aware and performs hierarchical protection to boost QoE of 360-degree videos in mobile scenarios. Experiments demonstrate our protocol achieves desirable improvements over the reference schemes in QoE of 360-degree videos.

\tightsection{Discussion}

\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent{\bf Why specialized protocols?}
Most solutions of 360-degree video streaming today are built on 
existing HTTP-based protocols designed for traditional 
videos, such as video-on-demand content, 
which are arguably less demanding than immersive 360-degree 
videos in both throughput and delay. While this is not 
without reason (\eg to be compatible with HTTP and reuse CDN servers 
make perfect sense economically), we also see reasons 
to think otherwise. One argument of our work is that specialized 
protocols (FOV-based FEC coding over UDP) can achieve 
significantly better quality. Moreover, Dante is compatible with 
classic streaming stacks like RTP ~\cite{rfc5109}, which have been 
deployed in many legacy services. We leave the question of
deployability of a new specialized video protocol to
future investigation.

\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent{\bf Relationship to bitrate adaptation:}
Beside deployability, another concern of Dante is how it should 
interact with application-layer bitrate adaptation. On one hand, 
they are functionally complementary. Dante should treat tiles  
encoded with application-specified bitrates as individual files, 
and select FEC redundancy independently to the bitrate of each 
tile. On the other hand, they do affect the performance of each 
other. For instance, if FOV prediction is inaccurate, setting FEC 
redundancy intelligently will not be very helpful, because we 
will probably optimize the video quality of an area not 
eventually viewed. Although the current design of Dante in theory 
is able to work with arbitrary FOV prediction (\ie one can set 
any values for $\gamma_{i,j}$ in Equation~\ref{eq:obj}), it is 
unclear how much FOV prediction accuracy is necessary for FEC 
redundancy adaptation to be useful.

\tightsection{Conclusion}
This paper proposes Dante, an FOV-aware UDP-based streaming 
protocol for 360-degree videos which leverages the hierarchical 
spatial structure of FOVs. We present adaptive 
FEC coding strategy to prioritize areas that the viewer
is likely to watch. The preliminary results show that Dante achieves
better 360-degree video quality than non FOV-aware UDP-based 
baselines and state-of-the-arts TCP-based baseline.
% protection to counter limited bandwidth and error-prone problems in wireless networks. Experiments demonstrate Dante achieves desirable gains on 360-degree video QoE against reference schemes.
