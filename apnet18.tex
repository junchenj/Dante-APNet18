\section*{Abstract}
As 360-degree videos grow dramatically in popularity, more 
applications demand the ability to stream 360-degree videos to 
wirelessly connected devices, such as smartphone headsets. However, 
the limited and unstable network capacity of wireless networks make 
them ill-suited to the quality of experience requirements of 
360-degree videos, \ie high resolution with low delay and little 
jitter. A natural solution is to leverage the fact that at any 
moment, a viewer watches only a small spatial region of the video, 
called FOV (field of view), which allows for better allocation of 
network bandwidth in the region that the user actually watches. 
Previous efforts on 360-degree videos have largely focused on how to 
differentiate spatial areas by different encoded bitrates. While we 
also use the concept of FOV-aware streaming, this paper explores a 
different design space than application-layer adaptation. We present 
a custom UDP-based transport strategy, called {\em Dante}, which 
adapts to dynamic network conditions by encoding and scheduling data 
packets based on how close they are to the FOV. Dante is 
complementary to application-level bitrate adaptation strategies, and
can be deployed by replacing the existing underlying transport 
protocol with minimal changes to the video player. Experimental 
results show that Dante achieves \fillme.

%360-degree videos have been widely applied due to its unprecedented immersive experience. The appreciation of watching 360-degree videos
%on untethered mobile devices, such as smartphone headsets,
%is considered to be a more promising trend, which, however, is hampered by the
%poor Quality of Experience (QoE), subject to limited bandwidth and error-prone characteristic of wireless networks.
%Fortunately, the key observation that only a small portion of a 360-degree video is
%perceived by users at any time, i.e., Field Of View (FOV), implies that unequal attention
%should be given different regions spatially and can
%be utilized to mitigate dependence on stable network condition and ultra-high bandwidth. Currently, the state-of-the-art schemes, like FOV-aware tile-based streaming in the application layer, almost based on FOV-aware bit-rate adaptation, transport protocol of which, however, fails to consider FOV. So, we propose an application-layer protocol, reliability scheme of which is FOV-aware and performs hierarchical protection to boost QoE of 360-degree videos in mobile scenarios. Experiments demonstrate our protocol achieves desirable improvements over the reference schemes in QoE of 360-degree videos.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a multipath protocol for 360-degree videos, which, based on multipath and FEC, performs hierarchical protection to counter limted bandwidth and error-prone problems in wireless networks. Experiments demonstrate Dante achieves desirable gains on 360-degree video QoE against reference schemes.
